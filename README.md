# Twitter-Sentiment-Challenge

##Overview

This is the code for the Twitter Sentiment Analysis challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #2' by @Sirajology on YouTube. The code uses the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and the TextBlob library to perform Sentiment Analysis on each Tweet. Moreover, the code alot uses numpy and matplotlib to perform some simple statistical analysis. It shows the number of positive and negative tweets about Theresa May.

##Dependencies

tweepy (http://www.tweepy.org/)
textblob (https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)
numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)

##Challenge

Last week, it was disclosed that there is currently a no deal Brexit. Hence, I was interested to see what the public opinion was of Theresa May (UK Prime Minister) was. I applied Siraj's sentiment analysis by getting a sample of 100 tweets about Theresa May and analysising their Sentiment. Next, I stored the results in a CSV file called sentiment.csv. Finally, I used numpy and matplotlib to analyse the data. Here is the result of the analysis :

33% Positive
67% Negative
